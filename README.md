# Minimal Obsidian

### Disclaimer

This theme is provided as is, and is focused on my personal use of Obsidian. As such I haven't optimized or tested it with all the features of Obsidian that I don't frequently use. Since this theme modifies significant parts of the Obsidian interface, it might break with future updates. It also may be incompatible with other bits of custom CSS you have. The file is organized in such a way that you can comment out sections that may be causing conflicts.

### Goals
This theme aims to create a focused editing experience and bring the app closer to [Mac OS HIG conventions](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/themes/)

- Use native fonts, more consistent font sizes, and smaller font sizes in the side panels
- Use the default arrow cursor for UI elements unless they are links within a file
- Long file names are  trimmed with ellipses to fit on a single line

### Features
- Several features are disabled by default but can easily be re-enabled. These include scrollbars, tooltips, status bar, file matches and the root folder name
- Focus Mode, hides all borders and extra icons when sidebars are collapsed
- Nicer checklists similar to Apple Notes
- Pill-style tags
